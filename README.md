# 2D-Collision-Simulator
Simulates the collision of two stress balls, taking into consideration rotation and elasticity. Computations used included conservation of linear momentum, forces, kinematics and conservation of energy. Done for AP Physics C.
The two CSV files are sample outputs and the graph of the collision. You can see the angle of deflection.
Note: This is a simulation where each frame is computer based on the information given in the previous frame, making it real-time.
